# QCMD_calculator

This is GUI-based software which enables calculation of
viscoelastic properties from quartz crystal microbalance (QCM-D) data by
fitting ΔF and ΔD QCM data to the
Kelvin-Voigt model to obtain viscosity and shear modulus of
an adlayer film, enabling estimation of G' and G'' (elastic and loss moduli).

Use the *User Inputs* section to input experimental data. Run the
viscoelastic model. Once the solution is found, you may adjust
the range of μ and η values to limit the search space and obtain
a solution with higher precision.
